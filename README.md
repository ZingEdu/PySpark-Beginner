Project # 1: We have the temperature readings taken at 8 different intervals in a day for 5 days. As a data scientist you are given this data set and find the following: 

  a - Minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, variance, and median  temperature for each day
  
  b - Minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, variance, and median  temeperature for each interval
  
Project # 2: For the given data set, conver the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and get all the temperature data points greater than 13 degree celsius.

Project # 3: For the given data set, 

  a - Calculate the average grades per semester, each year, for each student.
  
  b - Top 3 studetns with highest average grades in the 2nd year.
  
  c - Bottom 3 studetnts with lowest average grades in the second year.
  
  d - Students in the 2nd semester of the 2nd year, who have earned more than 80% average.
  
Project # 4: For the given data set,
  
  a - Calculate how many research projects were initiated in the three years.
  
  b - No of projects completed in the first year.
  
  c - No of projects completed in the first two years.
  
Project # 5: For the given data set,
  
  a - Calculate the number of data points and summation of air velocities over a day.
  
  b - Calculate mean, variance, sample variance, standard deviation, and sample standard deviation of air data.
  
Project # 6: For the given data set,

  a - Calculate the mean life in hours for bulbs of each filament type
  
  b - Calculate the mean life in hours for bulbs of each power level
  
  c - Calcuate the mean life in hours based on both filament type and power
  
Project # 7: Calculate the page rank
